# Deploy SQL Server Integration Services packages to Azure
Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows in the cloud for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores, process/transform the data by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Spark, Azure Data Lake Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning, and publish output data to data stores such as Azure SQL Data Warehouse for business intelligence (BI) applications to consume. 

This tutorial provides steps for provisioning an Azure-SSIS integration runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory. Then, you can use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to deploy SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages to this runtime on Azure. In this tutorial, you do the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime
> * Start the Azure-SSIS integration runtime
> * Deploy SSIS packages
> * Review the complete script

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin. For conceptual information on Azure-SSIS IR, see [Azure-SSIS integration runtime overview](concepts-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime).

## Prerequisites
- **Azure SQL Database server**. If you don't already have a database server, create one in the Azure portal before you get started. This server hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). We recommend that you create the database server in the same Azure region as the integration runtime. This configuration lets the integration runtime write execution logs to SSISDB without crossing Azure regions. 
- **Azure PowerShell**. Follow the instructions in [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). You use PowerShell to run a script to provision an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that runs SSIS packages in the cloud. 

## Launch Windows PowerShell ISE
Start **Windows PowerShell ISE** with administrative privileges. 

## Create variables
Copy and pate the following script: Specify values for the variables. 

```powershell
$SubscriptionName = "<Azure subscription name>"
$ResourceGroupName = "<Azure resource group name>"
# Data factory name. Must be globally unique
$DataFactoryName = "<Data factory name>" 
# In public preview, only EastUS amd EastUS2 are supported.
$DataFactoryLocation = "EastUS" 

# Azure-SSIS integration runtime information. This is a Data Factory compute resource for running SSIS packages
$AzureSSISName = "<Specify a name for your Azure-SSIS IR>"
$AzureSSISDescription = "<Specify description for your Azure-SSIS IR"
# In public preview, only EastUS and NorthEurope are supported.
$AzureSSISLocation = "EastUS" 
 # In public preview, only Standard_A4_v2, Standard_A8_v2, Standard_D1_v2, Standard_D2_v2, Standard_D3_v2, Standard_D4_v2 are supported
$AzureSSISNodeSize = "Standard_A4_v2"
# In public preview, only 1-10 nodes are supported.
$AzureSSISNodeNumber = 2 
# In public preview, only 1-8 parallel executions per node are supported.
$AzureSSISMaxParallelExecutionsPerNode = 2 

# SSISDB info
$SSISDBServerEndpoint = "<Azure SQL server name>.database.windows.net"
$SSISDBServerAdminUserName = "<Azure SQL server - user name>"
$SSISDBServerAdminPassword = "<Azure SQL server - user password>"
# Pricing tier of you Azure SQL server. For example S0, S3 etc. 
$SSISDBPricingTier = "<pricing tier of your Azure SQL server>" 
```

## Validate the connection to database
Add the following script to validate your Azure SQL Database server server.database.windows.net. 

```powershell
$SSISDBConnectionString = "Data Source=" + $SSISDBServerEndpoint + ";User ID="+ $SSISDBServerAdminUserName +";Password="+ $SSISDBServerAdminPassword
$sqlConnection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection $SSISDBConnectionString;
Try
{
    $sqlConnection.Open();
}
Catch [System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException]
{
    Write-Warning "Cannot connect to your Azure SQL DB logical server/Azure SQL MI server, exception: $_"  ;
    Write-Warning "Please make sure the server you specified has already been created. Do you want to proceed? [Y/N]"
    $yn = Read-Host
    if(!($yn -ieq "Y"))
    {
        Return;
    } 
}
```

## Log in and select subscription
Add the following code to the script to log in and select your Azure subscription: 

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName $SubscriptionName
```

## Create a resource group
Create an [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) using the [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) command. A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed as a group. The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `westeurope` location.

If your resource group already exists, don't copy this code to your script. 

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Location $DataFactoryLocation -Name $ResourceGroupName
```

## Create a data factory
Run the following command to create a data factory:

```powershell
Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2 -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                        -Location $DataFactoryLocation `
                        -Name $DataFactoryName
```

## Create an integration runtime
Run the following command to create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that runs SSIS packages in Azure: 

```powershell
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $SSISDBServerAdminPassword -AsPlainText -Force
$serverCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($SSISDBServerAdminUserName, $secpasswd)
Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime  -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                                            -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
                                            -Name $AzureSSISName `
                                            -Type Managed `
                                            -CatalogServerEndpoint $SSISDBServerEndpoint `
                                            -CatalogAdminCredential $serverCreds `
                                            -CatalogPricingTier $SSISDBPricingTier `
                                            -Description $AzureSSISDescription `
                                            -Location $AzureSSISLocation `
                                            -NodeSize $AzureSSISNodeSize `
                                            -NodeCount $AzureSSISNodeNumber `
                                            -MaxParallelExecutionsPerNode $AzureSSISMaxParallelExecutionsPerNode 
```

## Start integration runtime
Run the following command to start the Azure-SSIS integration runtime: 

```powershell
write-host("##### Starting your Azure-SSIS integration runtime. This command takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete. #####")
Start-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                                             -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
                                             -Name $AzureSSISName `
                                             -Force

write-host("##### Completed #####")
write-host("If any cmdlet is unsuccessful, please consider using -Debug option for diagnostics.")                                  
```
This command takes from **20 to 30 minutes** to complete. 

## Deploy SSIS packages
Now, use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to deploy your SSIS packages to Azure. Connect to your Azure SQL server that hosts the SSIS catalog (SSISDB). The name of the Azure SQL server is in the format: `<servername>.database.windows.net` (for Azure SQL Database). 

See the following articles from SSIS documentation: 

- [Deploy, run, and monitor an SSIS package on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-deploy-run-monitor-tutorial)   
- [Connect to SSIS catalog on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-connect-to-catalog-database)
- [Schedule package execution on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-schedule-packages)
- [Connect to on-premises data sources with Windows authentication](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-connect-with-windows-auth) 

## Full script
In this release, you must use PowerShell to provision an instance of Azure-SSIS integration runtime that runs SSIS packages in the cloud. Currently, it's not possible to provision this runtime by using Azure portal. 

The PowerShell script in this section configures an instance of Azure-SSIS integration runtime in the cloud that runs SSIS packages. After you run this script successfully, you can deploy and run SSIS packages in the Microsoft Azure cloud with SSISDB hosted in Azure SQL Database.

1. Launch the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
2. In the ISE, run the following command from the command prompt.    
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
3. Copy the PowerShell script in this section and paste it into the ISE.
4. Provide appropriate values for the script parameters in the "SSIS in Azure specifications" section at the beginning of the script. These parameters are described in the next section.
5. Run the script. The `Start-AzureRmDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime` command near the end of the script runs for **20 to 30 minutes**.

> [!NOTE]
> The script connects to your Azure SQL Database to prepare the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). The script also configures permissions and settings for your VNet, if specified, and joins the new instance of Azure-SSIS integration runtime to the VNet.

## Join Azure-SSIS IR to a VNet
If you use an Azure SQL Managed Instance (Private Preview) to host the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) catalog inside a virtual network (VNet), you must also join your Azure-SSIS integration runtime to the same virtual network. Azure Data Factory version 2 (Preview) lets you join your Azure-SSIS integration runtime to a classic VNet. For more information, see [Join Azure-SSIS runtime to a VNet](join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network.md).

For a full script to create an Azure-SSIS runtime that joins a VNet, see [create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md).

## Monitor and manage Azure-SSIS IR
See the following articles for details about monitoring and managing an Azure-SSIS IR. 

- [Monitor an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](monitor-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime)
- [Manage an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](manage-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md)
